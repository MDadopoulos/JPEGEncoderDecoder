# JPEGEncoderDecoder
This project is focused on implementing a baseline sequential DCT-based encoder/decoder for static images, adhering to the JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1:1994) standard. This project aims to provide a simplified yet efficient approach to JPEG image processing, making it ideal for educational purposes and foundational development in image processing since it is part of the course MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS.
